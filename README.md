# Anisotropic Warp Bubble Simulation

This repository hosts the Jupyter Notebook for the simulation and analysis of an anisotropic warp bubble using positive energy densities. The notebook explores a novel approach to creating a warp bubble, building on recent advancements by Eric Lentz. The methodology involves creating a spacetime grid, refining the metric tensor and energy-momentum tensor, and dynamically applying a warp factor. Numerical simulations analyze various configurations of bubble radius, density, and speed.

## Introduction

The concept of warp fields represents a transformative approach to theoretical faster-than-light (FTL) travel, manipulating the very fabric of space-time. Traditional models often require exotic negative energies and pose numerous scientific and engineering challenges. In contrast, this investigation adopts a novel approach by employing positive-energy solutions to overcome these hurdles and push the boundaries of theoretical feasibility.

## Methodology

The methodology involves:
- Creating a spacetime grid.
- Refining the metric tensor and energy-momentum tensor.
- Dynamically applying a warp factor.

Numerical simulations are used to analyze various configurations of bubble radius, density, and speed.

## Analysis of Results

The notebook provides a detailed analysis of the results for different configurations, focusing on the stability and scalability of the warp bubble. Both numerical data and plain English explanations are included for each configuration.

## Conclusion

The results demonstrate that a warp bubble can be sustained using positive energy densities, with stable energy presence and manageable stress levels. This study improves upon Lentz's model by offering a more practical and efficient approach to warp drive technology.
